			<h1>About snelSLiM</h1>
			<p class="lead">
				SnelSLiM was developed as part of the Bachelor Paper of Bert Van de Poel under supervision of Prof. dr. Dirk Speelman at the University of Leuven, Faculty of Arts, Department of Linguistcs. This software aims to make Stable Lexical Marker Analysis quick and painless for researchers who might be less skilled with computers and statistics.<br><br>
				Most of the heavy lifting is done by a set of go applications that depending on the format may use FOSS tools such as xmllint and foliafolie.
