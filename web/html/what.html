				Stable Lexical Marker Analysis is a method to statistically determine keywords in a corpora based on contrastive statistics. It was first introduced in 2008 by Speelman, Grondelaers and Geeraerts in "Variation in the choice of adjectives in the two main national varieties of Dutch".<br><br>
				The basic principle of the technique is to create a raw list of frequencies per item per corpus, and then investigate their keyness by based on the frequency in both corpora and the number of other items in both corpora, combined with an association measure like positive likelihood ratio. For more information concerning the statistics at hand, please refer to <a href="http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/qlvl/prints/dehertog_heylen_speelman_9999draft_Stable_lexical_marker.pdf">De Hertog, Heylen and Speelman - Stable Lexical Marker Analysis: a corpus-based identification of lexical variation</a>.<br><br>
				The resulting values produced by the association measure per item, make it possible to create a list of keywords in decreasing keyness per corpus.
