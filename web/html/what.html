				Stable Lexical Marker Analysis is a method to statistically determine keywords in corpora based on contrastive statistics. It was first introduced in 2008 by <a href="https://books.google.be/books?id=XuWn7dNGyokC&pg=PA205">Speelman, Grondelaers and Geeraerts in "Variation in the choice of adjectives in the two main national varieties of Dutch"</a> and then further enhanced by De Hertog, Heylen, Speelman and Kockaert with <a href="http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/qlvl/prints/dehertog_heylen_speelman_9999draft_Stable_lexical_marker.pdf">effect size</a> and <a href="http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/qlvl/prints/DeHertog_Heylen_Kockaert_Speelman_9999draft_Prevalence_multiword_term_candidates.pdf">multiword</a> analysis.<br><br>
				It is different from most forms of keyword analysis in that it doesn't compare the complete corpora based on a global frequency list of each corpus, but uses the frequencies of words in the individual texts or fragments within the corpus. Each possible combination of one text from both corpora is then analysed separately. For more information concerning the statistics at hand, please refer to <a href="http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/qlvl/prints/dehertog_heylen_speelman_9999draft_Stable_lexical_marker.pdf">De Hertog, Heylen and Speelman - Stable Lexical Marker Analysis: a corpus-based identification of lexical variation</a> as well as the help page <a href="?statistics">What statistics are used?</a> for information on the implementation within this application.</p>
